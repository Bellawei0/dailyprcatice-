// Complexity Analysis

// Time Complexity : O(N + M)O(N+M), where NN is a number of nodes (vertices) and MM is a number of edges.

// Space Complexity : O(N)O(N). This space is occupied by the visited dictionary and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the queue since we are adopting the BFS approach here.
